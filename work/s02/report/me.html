<h1>Presentation of my self in the course DA377B Programvaruutveckling för webben</h1>

<p><img src="../s01/images/profilbild.jpg" width="500" alt="Me on an image"></p>

<p>Hello there, my name is Oscar Odelstav. Born in Kristianstad but mostly raised in Broby/Knislinge
    in the small county of östra göinge just outside of Kristinastad. In my youth my main activity was 
    skateboarding although i exercised some thai boxing as well. Secondary me and my friends started a 
    small gaming LAN organisation, this was back in the days when internet was running on 56k modems for most people.
    Im one of the few student who mainly use Linux as an operatingsystem for my computer. These days i consider
    Linux much more user friendly that back in the 2000 when i used a red hat dist for setting upp dedicated
    gaming servers. I was attending gymnasium in Sibbhult and studied cooking and worked as a chef for a few
    years after graduating. After switching jobs and traveling through asia for a while i came back to Kristianstad
    and started studying again. I now live roughly 30 min outside kristianstad, quite offgrid countryside, with my 
    girlfriend and our 1.5 year old daughter, a cat and some chickens.  
</p>
<p>I have been interested in computers since early age and been wondering about programming for many years 
    before i decided to study developement. As i am a bit of a goofy guy with a lot of ideas the main reason
    for studying was to get the tools needed for making my ideas reality. In light of this i intend to start
    my own company directly after graduating and become an entrepreneur. As i have already identified a need
    for a software in a relatively small branch that several of my friends work in i hope to develope a software
    that they can use in their work and increases the efficiency of their work.
