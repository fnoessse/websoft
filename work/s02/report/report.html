<h2>S01</h2>
<p>1. Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</p>

<p>I know and ahve used Git and Github a few years now. However Markdown and Github Pages i am not familliar with.
Now that i have done the assignement 1 i think that GH pages was failry easy to use. </p>
    
<p>2. Have you ever created websites before?</p>
<p>I have not. Perhaps some small crappy page and very little html back in the lunarstorm days.
    I did host a premade website on a local machine for LAN-parties around 99-00 for gaming statistics. 
    My experince is quite limited with all of it, but i think i'll manage.</p>
    
<p>3. Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</p>
    <p>From previous curse in network applications i learned to set up a webserver and restful services. 
    We did some small laboration creating a small form for sending some variables as a query to the webserver
    and create a response. In terms of protocol i am familliar with http and https protocols. We did 
    study this in some earlier courses. Most of the previous web development has been in restful services
    on both server and client side. </p>
    
<p>4. What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    I have gotten acquainted with VS code and forking a repo as instructed in the assignement. I learned to create
    a small html page with links and added a picture and some small info. I learned to change background color and
     text color with css tags. Finally i learned to publish the work to GH pages.</p>
