            <h2>S01</h2>
            <p>1. Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</p>

            <p>I know and ahve used Git and Github a few years now. However Markdown and Github Pages i am not familliar with. Now that i have done the assignement 1 i think that GH pages was failry easy to use. </p>

            <p>2. Have you ever created websites before?</p>
            <p>I have not. Perhaps some small crappy page and very little html back in the lunarstorm days. I did host a premade website on a local machine for LAN-parties around 99-00 for gaming statistics. My experince is quite limited with all of it,
                but i think i'll manage.</p>

            <p>3. Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</p>
            <p>From previous curse in network applications i learned to set up a webserver and restful services. We did some small laboration creating a small form for sending some variables as a query to the webserver and create a response. In terms of
                protocol i am familliar with http and https protocols. We did study this in some earlier courses. Most of the previous web development has been in restful services on both server and client side. </p>

            <p>4. What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            I have gotten acquainted with VS code and forking a repo as instructed in the assignement. I learned to create a small html page with links and added a picture and some small info. I learned to change background color and text color with css tags. Finally
            i learned to publish the work to GH pages.</p>

            <h2>S02</h2>
            <p>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</p>

            <p>No, i have no previous experience these languages. I could argue that i have tested some HTML roughly 20 years ago but i don't think it's relevant anymore. I have heard about all three before and have some insight to what each part is responsible
                for.
            </p>

            <p>Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</p>

            <p>HTML is a markup language used for structuring a web page. This is where content is added and placed throughout the page. CSS is used to add styling such as colors etc to your website. Probably my weakest part as i am not very artistic.n Javascript
                is used to add active/interactive content to a web page. Javascript is content that is run directly in the browser. I also looked at PHP and from what i understand PHP scripts are more commonly executed on serverside. I looked at creating
                a contact form. However github pages does not support this and i will set up my own webserver to try and get it running later on.
            </p>

            <p>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</p>

            <p>The browser interpets the information and shows it. Information and requests are sent using HTTP packets. A browser sends a request in HTTP format to the web server. The server tries to identify the request and returns the information that
                is to be showed in the browser.
            </p>

            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>

            <p>I have learned to add various things and utilize html sections such as Header, body and footer. Furthermore i have learned how to utilize stylesheets for using css. A lot of information and practical learning has been related to working with
                css. Some basic structural insights into how javascript is used within webpages. At last we got a quick look into what kind of frameworks are used and how popular different frameworks are.

            <h2>S03</h2>
            <p>Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</p>
            <p>No i have no previous experience at all of client side javascript. I havve of course heard of it but since i haven't looked at webdevelopement until now i haven't really had a strong enough reson to start with it.</p>
            <p>Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</p>
            <P>I see a lot of similarities with several programming languages. I would say that some parts a similar to java where as some parts are a bit lite python. In the end a lot of functionality is quite similar in most languages. Since i have used
                both objectoriented as well as functional programming languages a lot is similar but still quita a lot of diffrences in how the language is utilized.</P>
            <p>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?</p>
            <p>I have spent a lot of time with resources on the web obtaining information and looking at examples of how javascript is used. I then approached the problem with trial and error playing around to get acquainted with javascript to what works
                and what does not. Even though my css/styling skills is not the greatest i think i managed to fulfill all assignment requirements. As this task had grade 3-5 requirements i did them all and i am aiming for a grade 5. I think the functionality
                of my code turned out as i expected. I spent some time just getting the functionality to work and then additional time to clean up the code and optimize the implementation such as replacing some for loops with foreach loops and so on.
                At thie moment of writing this i may not have completely placed the entire flag as a js object, more the functionality of it. However as also said where feasible i think this can count as fulfilling the requirement. The duck however is
                completely as a js object and is only called in the html and thereby i think i have showed that i know how to use this.</p>
            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>For this section i learned a lot. I got acquainted more with both html and css, for example using select in html to use with javascript. I played around a lot with the uck in javascript to make it move across the sreen in different speed and
                change direction at edges aswell as when the mouse hover above it. If u click the duck it will sometimes stop, make a kwack statement and change the speed. I also took some time to make the duck background transparent so it can move across
                the flags without showing the edges of the image. I also learned a lot from the municipalities apart from the selection by building the html table and create some style to it and added a click option for data cells. In order to change
                it up a bit i downloaded a bug script in js that is added to the about page to show how a java object can be initiated with controllers. I learned to do some transitioning in css before the actual task that i applied to header links. </p>
