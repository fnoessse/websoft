            <h2>S01</h2>
            <p>1. Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</p>

            <p>I know and ahve used Git and Github a few years now. However Markdown and Github Pages i am not familliar with. Now that i have done the assignement 1 i think that GH pages was failry easy to use. </p>

            <p>2. Have you ever created websites before?</p>
            <p>I have not. Perhaps some small crappy page and very little html back in the lunarstorm days. I did host a premade website on a local machine for LAN-parties around 99-00 for gaming statistics. My experince is quite limited with all of it,
                but i think i'll manage.</p>

            <p>3. Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</p>
            <p>From previous curse in network applications i learned to set up a webserver and restful services. We did some small laboration creating a small form for sending some variables as a query to the webserver and create a response. In terms of
                protocol i am familliar with http and https protocols. We did study this in some earlier courses. Most of the previous web development has been in restful services on both server and client side. </p>

            <p>4. What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            I have gotten acquainted with VS code and forking a repo as instructed in the assignement. I learned to create a small html page with links and added a picture and some small info. I learned to change background color and text color with css tags. Finally
            i learned to publish the work to GH pages.</p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>S02</h2>
            <p>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</p>

            <p>No, i have no previous experience these languages. I could argue that i have tested some HTML roughly 20 years ago but i don't think it's relevant anymore. I have heard about all three before and have some insight to what each part is responsible
                for.
            </p>

            <p>Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</p>

            <p>HTML is a markup language used for structuring a web page. This is where content is added and placed throughout the page. CSS is used to add styling such as colors etc to your website. Probably my weakest part as i am not very artistic.n Javascript
                is used to add active/interactive content to a web page. Javascript is content that is run directly in the browser. I also looked at PHP and from what i understand PHP scripts are more commonly executed on serverside. I looked at creating
                a contact form. However github pages does not support this and i will set up my own webserver to try and get it running later on.
            </p>

            <p>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</p>

            <p>The browser interpets the information and shows it. Information and requests are sent using HTTP packets. A browser sends a request in HTTP format to the web server. The server tries to identify the request and returns the information that
                is to be showed in the browser.
            </p>

            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>

            <p>I have learned to add various things and utilize html sections such as Header, body and footer. Furthermore i have learned how to utilize stylesheets for using css. A lot of information and practical learning has been related to working with
                css. Some basic structural insights into how javascript is used within webpages. At last we got a quick look into what kind of frameworks are used and how popular different frameworks are.

            <h2>S03</h2>
            <p>Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</p>
            <p>No i have no previous experience at all of client side javascript. I havve of course heard of it but since i haven't looked at webdevelopement until now i haven't really had a strong enough reson to start with it.</p>
            <p>Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</p>
            <P>I see a lot of similarities with several programming languages. I would say that some parts a similar to java where as some parts are a bit lite python. In the end a lot of functionality is quite similar in most languages. Since i have used
                both objectoriented as well as functional programming languages a lot is similar but still quita a lot of diffrences in how the language is utilized.</P>
            <p>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?</p>
            <p>I have spent a lot of time with resources on the web obtaining information and looking at examples of how javascript is used. I then approached the problem with trial and error playing around to get acquainted with javascript to what works
                and what does not. Even though my css/styling skills is not the greatest i think i managed to fulfill all assignment requirements. As this task had grade 3-5 requirements i did them all and i am aiming for a grade 5. I think the functionality
                of my code turned out as i expected. I spent some time just getting the functionality to work and then additional time to clean up the code and optimize the implementation such as replacing some for loops with foreach loops and so on.
                At thie moment of writing this i may not have completely placed the entire flag as a js object, more the functionality of it. However as also said where feasible i think this can count as fulfilling the requirement. The duck however is
                completely as a js object and is only called in the html and thereby i think i have showed that i know how to use this.</p>
            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>For this section i learned a lot. I got acquainted more with both html and css, for example using select in html to use with javascript. I played around a lot with the uck in javascript to make it move across the sreen in different speed and
                change direction at edges aswell as when the mouse hover above it. If u click the duck it will sometimes stop, make a kwack statement and change the speed. I also took some time to make the duck background transparent so it can move across
                the flags without showing the edges of the image. I also learned a lot from the municipalities apart from the selection by building the html table and create some style to it and added a click option for data cells. In order to change
                it up a bit i downloaded a bug script in js that is added to the about page to show how a java object can be initiated with controllers. I learned to do some transitioning in css before the actual task that i applied to header links. </p>
            <p>What i did to earn grade 4-5</p>
            <p>Insted of show/hide the duck i added a boudry so that it moves horisontally between the edges of the screen and when it hits the edge it changes direction and speed. I also added so that if the mouse cursor hits the duck it changes direction
                and speed. If you manage to click it the duck says "kwack" and change speed and direction. I added and did the flag page. I added 4 municipalities and stored the paths in a json file. the municipalities are selectable and fills up the
                very nice html table. As a bonus i added a click event on the table cell showing an alert window with the cell data. I added the hide/show with transition in the flag page as requested. I did not make my duck or the flags objects as it
                said "where feasible" i did not consider it to be feasible to re-structure my code/script for this and utiilized js objects in later assignments.

            <h2>S04</h2>
            <p>Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</p>
            <p>I have no previous experience of node or npm. Closest work related to node/npm is developing restful server in java. It has some similarities in terms of restful of course but a lot of diffrences as well. It has been very a very useful experience.</p>
            <p>How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</p>
            <p>I feel quite good actually. It has been some up and downs getting acquainted with js but i'm starting to get a hang of it. Same goes for node and express. I still need some practice with the structure part but for the most part i think i understand
                how it works. I quite like express and working with node as quite a few configuration parts are a lot simpler than in pure java.</p>
            <p>Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</p>
            <p>I approached the assignement step by step according to the assignement description. Working from the examples that helped a lot. Working from the examples i then refactored it with adding and deleting parts to make it work for my intetions.
                As i have no prior experience with this part i continued with trial and error and solving bugs by reading error outputs in the browser. I suppose i had somewhat of a plan from reading the assignement or an image of what i was trying to
                acheive. With that in mind i jumped head first into the assignment to get started without overthinking to get more familliar with both javascript and node/express. It was a nice experience getting this to work on linux as installation
                and configuration was an additional step in order to get this to work.
            </p>
            <p>What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</p>
            <p>I amied for grade 5 and think i gave it an extra effort to present the result in a nice way. Only thing remaining so far is to refactor out the logic for lotto to a separate module, which i will do if i have the time.</p>
            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>I have learned a lot for this part. Quite a few new things working with javascript aquiring more skills in how to program with js. I have learned the basics of setting up node/express restful server as well as working with ejs for presenting
                a site and mixing js with html. Furthermore i learned how to utilize query strings in the browser and handle them in express with parsing in js and using the array.include for finding a match between generated data to query data. Some
                small error handling for only ouputing data if a query is actually sent and so on. It was a nice experience utilizing json responses from server to express even though i did not develop the usage further in this assignement. I learned
                a few new skills in using html and generating a table dynamicly with setting background colors depending on input in order to get a nice output. I realized that my directory structure is not according to instructions as i misinterpreted
                how the strucure should be. As a result i suppose i have a rather large refactoring to do. I will however ask if this is actually required as i consider it to be a lot of work that will mean less time to spend on actual assignements.
            </p>
            <p>What i did to earn grade 4-5</p>
            <p>Well i did it all! I added the lotto page. utilized javascript object from previous assignment requirement. I did all requirements of the lotto page and some more. I presented the lotto in a single html table with all lotto numbers 1-35 and
                colored the lotto draw numbers yellow, correct input numbers green and incorrect numbers red to show in a nice way how many correct numbers were drawn. And of course, printed how many correct numbers the lottery resulted in. </p>

            <h2>S05</h2>
            <p>How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</p>

            <p>I feel that php is a little bit messier than other programming languages. I do like how it is possible to utilize php together with html to create dynamic content. The way of factoring out header, footer and other content is very nice and
                quite simple. Perhaps it is my knowledge in php that is still limited or some framework needed but i had to go from php to js and back to php in order to achieve inline editing of html table which felt a bit complicated. But overall i
                am fairly satisfied with php. I would say that i prefer javascript over php in general but i do see how php could be prefered in some cases. Mostly for the convenience of factoring out content like header, menu, footer etc.
            </p>

            <p>Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</p>
            <p>Overall php feels quite similar to several languages like java and javascript. Most negative part i would say is the difference in syntax and using $ signs everywhere. Quite annoying actually. But structurewise it feels like most other OOP
                languages. </p>

            <p>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</p>

            <p>I did as i always do with head first, trial and error playing around to get a feel for the language. I aimed for grade 5 and completed all tasks. I did however spend most time on the last part to get a html table with inline CRUD operations
                working. The result was quite satisfying even thouhg i utilized som javascript as a middle script to get the functionality i was going for.</p>

            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>

            <p>I learned a lot! I have used a little php earlier as object oriented when learning unit testing. This was however quite different from using php in web development. It was a nice experience learning to use php with html for creating dynamic
                content from a database. The most rewarding was again to factor out page content but also database connection and generating html tables from the received content.
            </p>
            <p>What i did to earn grade 4-5</p>
            <p>Again i did it all and some more. single pages for create, update, delete. Then the prize, i did the read page that shows the entire database in a single table with create and delete buttons as well as an update button that makes the row inline
                editable in the table. This was not the easiest to accomplish. I might have cheated as i actually went from php to js to another php in order to make it work as i intended. This was one of the shortcomings of php that i could not find
                a pure php solution for.

            <h2>S06</h2>
            <p>What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages?</p>
            <p>Well, popularity of programming languages can indicate several things. How easy a language is to use, how well it performs or availability and quality of documentation. It does give some insight to which languages are developed further and
                has support for high trend functionality. As long as the trend for a language is going in the right direction it still comes down to personal preference or demand by companies. Knowing how several languages work is important as depending
                on what the service is supposed to do. HIghly popular languages and frameworks indicates easy and fast implementation of new products.</p>
            <p>What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?</p>
            <p>As i intend to start my own business when i graduate this question is highly relevant. Before this course i would have said java. Now i am moore interested in javascript and flutter framework as i intend to create software that will be used
                on both mobile and desktop envirioment. If flutter works as advertised this will have a large impact in the amount of implementation needed to support multiple plattforms.
            </p>
            <p> Do your own investigation on https://trends.google.com (Links to an external site.) to customize your own comparison on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results. </p>
            <p>Well, the results are a bit questinable. Google of course says that python now is the biggest laguage in programming. But google createn python so there is a bit of cobflict in interest. Especially when you look at world wide demographics
                and all countries in the world is between 1-5 in search interest where as china is 100. Correct me if i'm wrong but google withdrew from china and should not have access to this type of data there. So whiether or not one should trust google
                on theese results is not easy to intepret. They also claim php to be moore popular than javascript which i have not seen before as all forums i've visited promote js/java before php. The results of this investigation sure made me think
                about my choice in language and so i will do moore research before i make my final choice. However, google trends will not be my main source for this choice.</p>
            <p>If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?</p>

            <h2>S07</h2>
            <p>Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft technology.</p>
            <p>.Net aims to offer a complete developement envirioment utilizing a mvc approach. It is a bit different compared to javascript, php and REST with nodejs. But .Net packs all parts into one plattform so that a developer can go all the way from
                OOP classes and functionality to REST api, Database connection to the frontend. It has quite many similarities to other web and OOP developement languages. It offers quite a few framworks and other tools so that everything could be done
                within .Net. In my personal opinion the .Net REST and MVC is a bit different and not always as obvious as other envirioments and takes a bit of time to get a hang of. It is a mixture of pleasant developement and some dissapointments in
                structure and documentation that is classic microsoft.
            </p>
            <p>Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the course.</p>
            <p>The OOP part in .Net with C# is quite similar to javascript, php and java with some differences such as using namespaces instead of packages that can be confusing at first. Mostly the OOP part is however very similar to other OOP languages.
                In my opinion the MVC for REST services is the biggest difference. Even though it has some similarities with android and nodejs it feel a bit more complicated. The structure of paths and controllers is a bit different in its structure
                and takes a while to figure out. Mostly the .Net documentation for REST was a horrible experience in camparison. In the end i did not implement it as the documentation or a variety of forums claimed to be best practise, instead i found
                a way to implement it that is more similar to the nodejs/express or java way of setting up a REST service. With that in mind it can handle this appoach as well which is nice even though it was difficult to find how it could be done. I
                gave up on how the documentation and forums described the approach as it felt as an overcomplicated approach. The html forms with Razor was the most satisfying part once i got a hang of it. Utilizing Razor for this was a very nice way
                with good structure and an easy overview.
            </p>
            <p>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</p>
            <p>As always i jumped straight into solving the assignment researching solutions along the way as problems occured and looking a lot at the examples in order to figure out the general way of structuring diffrent parts. As always i aimed for a
                grade 5 and solves all the tasks in a quite satisfactory way. As i meantioned before my biggest issue was figuring out the mvc structure for REST and paths and probably implemented it in a way that does not completely follow the documentation
                guidelines. In the end i am quite satisfied with the result as i spent a lot of time solving the final parts of the assignment.</p>

            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>In the spirit of other TIL i learned a lot! I have not used .Net or C# at all before so a complete new overview of the .Net plattform. So everything from using C# and OOP to RESTFUL and Frontend I.E. a nice intro to fullstack developement
                in microsofts envirioment. Further moore i learned a bit about the mvc and razor framwork for creating forms and tables just like in other languages for this course. Some nice parts was working with Json and serializing to lists in C#
                and getting a initial insight as to how .Net structures works.

            <h2>S08</h2>
            <p>Members: Isak Zayane, Oscar Odelstav, Simon Westerdahl and Fredrik Lémon Larsson. The data collected: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_wnIwN9Sp8wWEU1myFZWR4r_xUvVyk82/view">Data</a> The pages compared are GitLab, which is hosted
                on Fredrik's server, Androids Developer page, and Wikipedia. Overall Wikipedia has the best time on each time measure. If you compare AndroidDev and Wikipedia, which both is for documentation but AndroidDev finished 100 times slower than
                Wikipedia. One could argue that AndroidDev should apply a wiki instead of their layout, to get better overall speed time. The AndroidDev is also about 10 times slower on first CPU idle time, so their page will not be as quickly responsive
                as wikipedia either. We chose Fredrik’s GitLab page just to see its response time for curiosity. Since it’s hosted on a server in Fredriks garage its surprising that it finishes 10 times faster than AndroidDev. Since AndroidDev got established
                business servers in comparison to Fredriks server. However measuring GitLab we only measured the first login page and not further into the site. When logged in you might see slower speed since there is more security as you log in. The
                GitLab and Android Devs First Input Delay (FID) are 1.78 and 0.59 seconds respectively. Going above 2-3 seconds can be too long for a user to have a pleasant experience, whilst Wikipedia's FID is 0.05, which is splendid! An important metric
                in the performance section is Time to Interactive. Wikipedia, having the best time at 0.7 seconds while GitLab and AndroidDe have 8.4 and 14.5 seconds respectively. Having 14.5 seconds on TTI is not good at all and users might end up using
                other sources than AndroidDev while for example looking up guides for Android Studio.
            </p>
            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>For thi section i have learned and gotten insights into how one can review the performance of a website. This can be useful when publishing a site to ensure that it responds fast. This could also be a way to evaluate a webhotel and make sure
                that the service they offer is reliable enough. I have also learned how big the difference can be in performance depending on what the site contains. This can be very useful to keep in mind when createing websites and also if one intends
                to host a website from a personal local server.

            </p>
            <p>What i did to earn grade 4-5</p>
            <p>For the console app: I did all the requirements. I added a search option that "Show all accounts that matches that searchstring by its number, full or substring match of label or by its owner. I added the move option and ofcourse it works
                as well as new account that saves it to the json file. And finally yes i organised my code using external class.
            </p>
            <p>For the webapp: i completed all requirements. I added a transfer funds option through a html form with a post method. And i did it with json rest api. I just realized i might have misse using put method, but in my defense put is used when
                modifying something. I consider a transfer to be a created request for modifying something... Nevertheless as a little something i am quite proud of the razor form format i used for utilizing dropdown lists used for selecting accounts
                for the operation. They are imported variables from the pagemodel. And actually the pagemodel has an object which model class has a lists that is imported into the form for selection. It also allows the form to be directly passed to the
                controlle where the parameter takes [FromForm] and creates a transfer object directly mapping the variables. Turned out quite nice, compact and very readable codewise.</p>

            <p>1. Injections. I have spent quite some time the last few years thinking about injections and how to make avoid having this vulnerability when developing. In our project i have implemented a login that i think is secure against injections.
                Firstly by using email instead of username with a check to make sure the input is a email. secondly only one user is selected when identified in the database. The entire implementation is done with the passport library that has built in
                checks. Alongside this i am using an envirioment variable enckosed in an envirioment file with a secret session key to avoid (2) Broken authentication. (3) Broken access control, in our project we utilize a function that ckecks whiether
                or not a user is logged in and uses a redirect depending on the login status. This function is placed in every route that requires a user to be logged in in order to be redirected to the path. As a secondary check we placed a function
                that requires a user to not be logged in in order to be alowed access to the login site so that a logged in user can not try to log in again. This works great but it also makes me think about how secure this is. I do beleive that it is
                correctly implemented as the logged in status is stored by the envirioment variable which in its turn is secured by a sha512-bit hash. along this on logout the session key is destroyed. I tried to do several injections targeting our login
                without success and thereby i think i managed to make it quite secure.

            <p>My own guidelines to create secure web applications. This is not very easy but, look at OWASP top 10 security risks and try to not do them. Look at what libraries are commonly used and trusted. If you dont know if a library is secure then
                google that shit. Actually for every function that you are not sure about, research it and see what communities consider best practise. Read documentation! A good thing could be to utilize tools like detectify to test your web pag efor
                vulnerabilities. If you intend to publish your site then most cloud providers like digitalocean has a lot of guides for what they recommend. As i do not think we have a lot of knowledge on the web security topic all frameworks, libraries
                or scripts for that matter should be researched. And lastly if your webpage or application will handle any sensitive information, find someone that knows security better than yourself and ask for advise. Or pay them to review your code.
                If you dont have the money, join a community that can review it.

            <p>What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
            <p>I knew e few of the top security risks, other i did not. Which i now know about. Can't really say i know how to avoid them but knowing about them i will be able to research them when the time comes that i will create something that will be
                in danger of creating these security risks. The video series of common security risks were really good. Something i learned that really stuck was how one can recreate scripts and use them against other users. I really want to know how
                this can be avoided and so i will eventually look in to this. Using scripts without checking if they have known security issues is something i will not do in the future. This was a relly good thing to know about.
